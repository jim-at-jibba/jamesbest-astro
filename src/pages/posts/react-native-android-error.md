React Native is a popular framework for developing mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to build apps for both iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase. However, like any software development process, React Native projects can encounter issues and errors that need to be resolved. One such problem is the occurrence of random build failures on Android due to a mismatch in the minCompiledSDK version.

### The Error

A random Android build failure occurred in our React Native project, and upon investigation, we discovered that it was caused by a mismatch in the minCompiledSDK version. The error message indicated that the androidx.browser package had been updated the previous day with a higher minCompiledSDK, leading to the failure.

The specific error message looked like this:

```bash
[...]
The minCompileSdk (34) specified in a
dependency's AAR metadata (META-INF/com/android/build/gradle/aar-metadata.properties)
is greater than this module's compileSdkVersion (android-33).
Dependency: androidx.browser:browser:1.6.0-beta01.
[...]
```

### The Fix

To resolve this issue, we needed to ensure that the androidx.browser package uses a compatible minCompiledSDK version with our project's compileSdkVersion. We made the necessary adjustments in the build.gradle file to force the usage of a specific version.

Here is the modified build.gradle file:

```gradle
[...]
dependencies {
   def work_version = "1.5.0"
    // Force androidx.browser:browser: 1.5.0 for transitive dependency
    implementation("androidx.browser:browser:$work_version") {
        force = true
    }
}
[...]
```

By specifying the desired version of the androidx.browser package and setting force to true, we ensured that the build system uses the compatible version regardless of any metadata discrepancies. In this case, we used version 1.5.0 to match our project's compileSdkVersion of android-33.

## Conclusion

Random build failures can be frustrating, especially when they occur due to seemingly unrelated package updates. In the case of a minCompiledSDK mismatch in React Native Android builds, ensuring compatibility between dependencies and the project's compileSdkVersion is crucial. By using the force option in the build.gradle file, we can override any conflicting metadata and specify the desired version for the problematic package.

It is important to regularly review and update dependencies in a React Native project to avoid potential compatibility issues. Additionally, staying informed about the latest updates and changes in packages and libraries can help prevent unexpected build failures and streamline the development process.
