I will write about what I think are essential packages for the CLI, a simple but super effective Vim setup and setting some sane Tmux defaults.\n\nIn this first article, I am going to list some of what I think are essential CLI packages. These are ones I use every day and could not live without. I am leaving Vim and Tmux off this list as they will get there own articles.\n\nI spend all my time in a terminal. This is where I do all my development, hacking and note-taking. Spending so much time there I want it to work for me, providing a buttery smooth experience.\n\nHere is a list of my top CLI packages.\n\n## 1. ZSH and oh-my-zsh:\n\nThis is my chosen shell. It has way too many features to list here but here are a choice few:\n\n- automatic cd: Just type the name of the directory\n- recursive path expansion: For example ‚Äú/u/lo/b‚Äù expands to ‚Äú/usr/local/bin‚Äù. This is not one I use much because I lead on the tools mentioned below.\n- spelling correction and approximate completion: If you make a small mistake typing a directory name, ZSH will fix it for you\n- plugin and theme support: ZSH includes many different plugin frameworks. This is where [`oh-my-zsh`](https://ohmyz.sh/) comings in. Its a community drive framework for managing your ZSH configuration.\n\n![ZSH](../images/posts/favourite-cli/zsh.png)\n\n## 2. FZF\n\n[FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is a command-line fuzzy finder. It is super fast, light and works so well with all my other tools.\n\n![fzf](../images/posts/favourite-cli/fzf.png)\n\n## 3. RipGrep (rg)\n\n[RipGrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is a stupid fast replacement for grep. It does away with lots of the hard to remember flags that grep requires. By default, it respects your `.gitignore`, and skips hidden files.\n\n## 4. Autojump\n\n[Autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) is a super-fast way to navigate your filesystem. It learns the directories you visit most and remembers them for next time.\n\n## 5. HTTPie\n\n[HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) is a user-friendly command line HTTP client. It has JSON support, syntax highlighting and lots more.\n\n## 6. Bat\n\n[Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) is a drop-in replacement for `cat` but with superpowers. It's highly configurable and supports syntax highlighting.\n\n![Bat](../images/posts/favourite-cli/bat.png)\n\n## 7. exa\n\n[exa](https://the.exa.website/) is a modern replacement for `ls`. It is highly configurable, provides better defaults.\n\n![HTTPie](../images/posts/favourite-cli/exa.png)\n\n## 8. twf\n\n[twf](https://github.com/wvanlint/twf) is a tree view explorer inspired by fzf.\n\n![HTTPie](../images/posts/favourite-cli/twf.png)\n\nYou can find my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/jim-at-jibba/my-dots). This is how I use them, how will you?\n\n# Thanks for reading üôè\n\nIf there is anything I have missed, or if there is a better way to do something then please let me know.\n\nCheck out our software focused podcast - [Salted Bytes](https://open.spotify.com/show/7IdlgpiDfYcOdCn57mPLvH?si=X1ArfHvqQXSOAfc1h7Y_Eg)\n"}]
