![Form](/images/code/telecharger.gif)

Telecharger is a [Youtube-DL](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) TUI. It provides the ability to build lists of videos you wish to download, rename the files, saving as audio only and a host of other functionality.

Not all the flags that youtube-dl allows are supported yet but you can provide them as a string on the form and telecharger will sort the rest out for you.

The SQLite database is created in a **telecharger** directory in your home directory. In the future config will likely live here too.
